# Predicting Peak Music Chart Position

This repository contains files related to an analysis of music data from Spotify's Web API to create a model to predict a song's peak rank on the Billboard top 100.  I love music and I love listening to new music. In High School, my friends and I started a rap group and made music after school. The group didn't last long because we all went our separate ways after high school.  

Since I have stopped making music, I have always wandered - "Is there was a quantitative way to predict the success of a song?" and "What are those important audio characteristics of those hit songs on the Billboard in the United States?" To answer these questions, I used a linear regression with lasso regualization to predict what a new song's peak rank position will be given a set of audio characteristics.
